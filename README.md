# pfsense notes widget
Notes widget to make obviously notes for pfsense dashboard.

the widget shuould be safe to use, but use with own risk...
as of pfsense official policy is to only use package manager plugins.

If someone wants to add this to pfsense or to make a better one, just gogogo, I have no motivation to do so.
Here's instructions to do so: https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/development/develop-packages.html

# Usage

1. Copy `widgets` and `include` to pfsense `/usr/local/www/widgets`
2. Enable widget from dashboard.
